**Overview and Goals

Data mining, especially when it comes to social science data, is quickly changing and becoming more popular. Today, societies produce a lot of written information through the news and social media, policy and legal documents, and interactions. 

  Unstructured text data is the next big thing in data science and analytics. Data mining has become an important way for academia and research agencies to measure data, find patterns and trends in real-time, understand the sentiment, find key insights, and build predictive models. 

Predictive models or classifying things or groups of cases in the data can solve economics, finance, and political problems. Data is also scarce and valuable in the Middle East and Africa research areas. Data mining can be a welcome rain in the desert within the mentioned region. This lecture introduces computational and statistical techniques for representing text data numerically. The main goal is to show how these techniques can be used to solve economics, finance, and political problems. 

A practical component will follow the lectures. Students will learn how to write computer programmes that will help them look at real-world datasets.

The lecture will walk you through the full data mining and analysis process, beginning with unstructured raw text and interpreting and visualising the finished data using the R programming language. 

  Quanteda, an online library for quantitative analysis of textual data, will be used in the lecture. Students will develop their text analysis skills through regular practice in R and investigate the application of these skills in various relevant, real-world case studies. 

This technical course involves coding in R. Knowledge of algebra and calculus is strongly recommended but not needed. Additionally, training in tertiary-level statistics and familiarity with a functional or object-oriented programming language is advantageous.
  Use the R statistical software package for lectures, class exercises, and homework but don’t know how to speak or write in it yet.

The course will cover a variety of popular methods for collecting, processing, and analysing text data. Supervised and unsupervised approaches. The course will cover topics like: 
- Web scraping methods use
- Text cleaning and preprocessing 
- Dictionary methods 
- Machine learning approaches
- Topic modelling
- Scaling with applied statistics
